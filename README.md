# Project 01 - Predict daily bike rental ridership

Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

# Project 02 - CNN Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification Ap

Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this modelâ€”this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.

# Project 03 - TV Script Generation

Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

# Project 04 - Face Generation

Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

# Project 05 - Train a Quadcopter How to Fly

In this project, we will design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice! Try to apply the techniques you have learnt in this module to find out what works best, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.
